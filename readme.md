# What is it?

A README is a text file that introduces and explains a project. It contains information that is commonly required to understand what the project is about.

## Why should I make it?

It's an easy way to answer questions that your [audience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience) will likely have regarding how to install and use your project and also how to collaborate with you.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phennnbnmbmnbmnbmnomenon'
```
