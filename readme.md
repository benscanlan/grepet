# What is it?

A README is a text file that introduces and explains a project. It contains information that is commonly required to understand what the project is about.

## Why should I make it?

It's an easy way to answer questions that your [audience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience) will likely have regarding how to install and use your project and also how to collaborate with you.

## Usage
open terminal and the type following.
```bash
sudo apt install git
git config --global user.name "benscanlan"
git config --global user.email "bscanlan@mail.csuchico.edu"
git config --global core.editor vi
git clone https://github.com/benscanlan/grepet
git config --global credential.helper store
git config --global credential.helper cache
#git remote set-url origin benscanlan@github.com:/benscanlan/grepet.git
cd grepet
make
sudo ./server #you cant run below 1024 as normal user. only as root can you run port 80 on ubuntu. bind is failing with no error message in logic. if port 80 run as sudo ./server on ubuntu
sudo lsof -Pi tcp:80 | head -3
sudo tcpdump port 80 #command works just slow to generate traffic data 
git commit -a
git push
```
open browser navigate to loopback http://127.0.0.1/hello


## Server Technology

```c
#include <sys/socket.h>
server()    {
    int sockfd = socket(server->ai_family, server->ai_socktype, server->ai_protocol);
    bind(sockfd, server->ai_addr, server->ai_addrlen);
    listen(sockfd, 10);

    while(1) {
        int client_fd = accept(sockfd,(struct sockaddr *) &client_addr, &addr_size);
    }
}
```

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate. Just kidding, we are using a compiled language so we don't need a ton of tests.

## NEED TO DO'S
server() Make sure this actually works not just over local loopback. Make a test server at home using any system like laptop with port forward open to 80 on router and open port on system.

routehandler() Needs to be able to get a route and return correct file.
